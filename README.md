# OpenGB
OpenGB is an open-source Nintendo Game Boy emulator written in C++ and SDL2. This was written mainly for fun so its goal is usability and clean code over accuracy.

## Building
The easiest way to build this emulator is using Visual Studio. Simply open the solution, link a local copy of SDL2 and build the OpenGB project. Tested on Windows 10 using Visual Studio 2017 and SDL 2.0.12.

A more cross platform build system is planned for the future.

# Tests
The emulator has been tested with [Blargg's tests](https://github.com/retrio/gb-test-roms) and.
